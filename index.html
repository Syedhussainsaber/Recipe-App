Take the two handles of the squeezer, and squeeze them together over a glass. Lime juice will pour out and into your glass. 
          
              2. With a handheld reamer: Instead of using the reamer built into a citrus juicer, try using a handheld plastic or wooden reamer. Simply slice the lime in half, then twist the reamer into one of the halves, slowly spinning it to break the membranes and extract juice.
              3. By hand: Simply halve the lime with a knife, place it in the palm of your hand with the cut side facing away from your palm, and compress your hand into a fist to release the juice"

                alt="1.Preheat the oven to 180 C, gas mark 4. In a bowl, cover the barberries with just-boiled water from the kettle; set aside to plump up. Meanwhile, cut off the tops of the tomatoes (reserve them for later) and scoop out the insides with a spoon. Discard the seeds and finely chop any leftover flesh. Put the bases in a baking dish, ensuring they fit snugly.

                2. Heat 1⁄2 tbsp oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes until starting to soften. Add the lamb, season and fry for 8-10 minutes until any excess liquid has evaporated, the lamb is browned and no pink meat remains. Stir in the tomato purée and spices; fry for 2 minutes more. Add any chopped tomato flesh and the rice, and fry for a final 2 minutes.
                
                3. Drain the barberries and stir into the pan with the dill, lemon zest and juice. Check the seasoning, adding more salt, pepper or lemon juice to taste. Pile the mixture into the hollowed-out tomatoes and top with the lids. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp oil and bake for 25-35 minutes, until the tops are starting to blister, and the tomato shells are soft but not collapsing. Serve with a green salad, if liked."
